This is my ping pong game made by python. For different OS users, I made differences and versions of my game. You can find a Windows, Mac and linux version of my game.
If you wish to remake my game, then here are the rules you have to follow:
.If you edit some of my code then give me credit
.You cannot publish it online as your own game, this is known as plagiarism and this is strictly not allowed
.You can show your remix to your friends however, you need to mention me.
.Anyways have fun remixing my code
